# Thumb Controlled Low-cost Prosthetic Robotic Arm

The commercially available prosthetics are mostly financially out of the reach for general people of developing countries. In this project, a low-cost robotic arm has been proposed which is affordable to above or below elbow amputees. Using servo motor powered end effector to construct the proposed system can enable a person to move, grasp and carry objects. A prototype of the model has been made to show the efficiency, productivity and cost analysis of the proposed system. The result displays that the system is cost-effective and affordable to the poverty-stricken section of the community.\
